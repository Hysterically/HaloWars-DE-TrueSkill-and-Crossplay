# HaloWars-DE-TrueSkill-and-Crossplay

**Competitive TrueSkill & CSR ratings, leaderboards, match history, and PC/Xbox cross-play for Halo Wars: Definitive Edition (Microsoft Store).**

🌐 **Live ladder: [halo-wars-definitive-edition-stats.pages.dev](https://halo-wars-definitive-edition-stats.pages.dev)** — leaderboards, player pages, and recent games from the current ranked community, updated automatically.

> ### ⬇️ [Download v2.0.0 — it updates itself from here on](../../releases/latest)
> Unzip, double-click `Install Auto-Load.bat` once, play. No terminal, no administrator rights — see [Installation](#installation). This is the **last download you'll ever need**: from now on the overlay offers each new version in-game, one click.
> On first launch the overlay downloads the community match history and the leaderboards fill themselves in; your own finished matches upload automatically. To be **rated**, press *Request to join* on the Verified Roster tab (see [Joining the ladder](#joining-the-ladder)). Prefer a purely local tracker? Delete the two `sync_` lines from `ms_trueskill_config.txt` and nothing is ever uploaded.

*2 min 17 sec — the TrueSkill™ and CSR leaderboards, the classic 1-50 ladder, match history, the invite-only Verified Roster, PC/Xbox cross-play, and the community stats site.*

### What each update did

- **v2.0.0** — post-game scoreboard recorded with every match; Random Map tab; one Leaderboards tab; one 1–50 curve; single Cross-Play switch; 200 fps; rematch and abandoned-match fixes.
- **v1.2.6** — **matches were being recorded with players missing.** A match that ended on the wrong frame could be saved short-handed — a 3v3 stored as a 3v2, or, when the gaps evened out, filed under the wrong size entirely (a 3v3 as a 1v1 or 2v2; 49 of 1178 recorded matches were affected). **No rating was ever changed by this** — every affected match failed the ladder's own checks and was left unrated — but the game itself showed the wrong players and teams in Match History and on the stats site, and never counted. Three end-of-match reads could each drop players (a briefly-low player slot count, a single failed read marking a player unreadable, an invalid team value on the final frame); all three are now held at their last known-good value for the match instead of trusting whatever the final frame returned. **Update even if you have not seen this happen**: the record is written by whoever is running the overlay, so a match you played can still be saved wrong by someone else's older copy — it only stops once players have updated.
- **v1.2.5** — **the anti-farm rule is gone, because it was making ratings inaccurate.** Winning as an 85%+ favourite used to earn each winner at most **+2 CSR** — but that cap was not applied to a displayed number, it was written back into the rating itself, replacing what TrueSkill 2 had just worked out about that player. Every match after it then started from the altered figure, and because ratings update against the other team's numbers too, one clamped win pulled a whole run of later results off on **both** sides. It also charged twice for the same thing: a match the system already called at 85% is precisely the match it pays almost nothing for, so the rule taxed an expectation the engine had already priced in, and held established players below their real level. It is retroactive: the full match history re-rates without it on first launch, releasing every gain that was ever clamped, so **CSR will shift** (69 standings move, almost all upward; classic TrueSkill™ is untouched, so board order does not change). The guards that stop farming outright are all unchanged — a match rates only when every player in it is on the Verified Roster, uneven lineups never rate, and the map has to fit the match size — as are placements and the Diamond 3 initial rank cap. The **Team Balancer** also loses *Keep Pairs*: it now offers **Best Balance (CSR)** and **Random Teams** as themed buttons along the bottom of the tab, with Random Teams re-rolling on a repeat press once a minute.
- **v1.2.4** — the **1–50 ladder now has a different top end per playlist**, because the boards do not play alike: rank **50** takes **2100** CSR in 1v1 (Standard and Deathmatch) and **2000** in 2v2, while 3v3 keeps its old **1900** exactly. Every bit of the extra distance is absorbed in ranks 40–50, so **ranks 1–39 are untouched on every board** and rank 40 still opens at 1419 everywhere. The **Champion** crest also moves down to each board's **rank 47** — **1895** in 1v1, **1825** in 2v2, **1720** in 3v3 — so the crest means the same thing on every playlist instead of being far harder to reach on one. Nothing about the rating changed: your CSR, your match history and your leaderboard position are exactly as they were, and only the rank numeral drawn beside them moves. A 1v1 rank 50 that reads 48 today is the same CSR it was yesterday — the ladder around it got longer. *(Superseded: the per-playlist split was later collapsed back onto one curve for every board — rank 50 at **2000**, Champion floor **1825** — which is what the ladder tables below describe.)*
- **v1.2.3** — the **placement diamond is readable now**. Its outline was drawn in near-black at partial opacity, which disappeared against the dark lobby card — and at 0 rated games the diamond is outline-only, so a brand-new player's rank slot looked empty rather than "0 of 10". The outline is now grey with a white number, at full strength and with a soft shadow behind it, so it holds up on the lobby card, the in-match scoreboard, and the match cards alike. The same art is on the website. Nothing else changed: your settings, ratings, and match history are untouched.
- **v1.2.2** — **country flags**: every gamertag now carries its player's flag — on both leaderboards, on the match cards, and on the Verified Roster — with the country's name on hover. Switch them off any time in **Settings → Appearance → Country Flags**; a player whose country isn't known simply shows no flag. Also a rating-rule fix: a match now rates only on a map built for its size (1v1 on a 1v1 map, 2v2 on a 2v2 map, 3v3 on a 3v3 map). The matchmade playlists always pair a ladder size with maps built for it, so a 1v1 played on a 3v3 map was a custom lobby rather than a ladder game, and it was scoring into the same ladder. Those games stay in your match history but move no rating and no win/loss counters. The fix is retroactive: the full match history re-rates on first launch, so ratings may shift.
- **v1.2.1** — two rating-rule fixes. Matches recorded with **uneven team sizes** (2v3, 1v3, ...) are no longer rated: matchmade lobbies are always even, so an uneven record means a disconnected player is missing from it, and rating it handed the "short-handed" side an undeserved upset win. And **placements are now CSR-only**, as intended — the classic TrueSkill™ board lists everyone again from their first counting game (v1.2.0 also hid players inside their first 10 rated games from that board). Both fixes are retroactive: the full match history re-rates on first launch, so ratings may shift.
- **v1.2.0** — **ranked ladder overhaul**: your first 10 rated games per playlist are now **placement matches** (you wear a placement diamond with your progress instead of a rank and join the skill leaderboards when they are done), the rank assigned after placements is **capped at Diamond 3 (CSR 1349)**, and winning as an **85%+ favourite** earned at most **+2 CSR** so lopsided lobbies couldn't be farmed (that last rule was **removed in v1.2.5**) — see [the rules](#placements-and-the-initial-rank-cap). Both surviving rules are retroactive: the full match history re-rates on first launch, so ratings may shift. Also fixed: veteran players could briefly show as 0/10 placements in Match History right after launch.
- **v1.1.17** — **critical fix**: opening the Match History tab could instantly close the game if a corrupted match record with an unreadable date had reached your PC through the community sync (one such record circulated on 2026-08-10). Such records now display a dash instead of crashing, are refused by the sync, and any copy already on your PC is cleaned out automatically on first launch — ratings replay once so the leaderboards stay consistent. Skirmish-vs-A.I. games also no longer appear in Match History.
- **v1.1.16** — Match History: the winner icon could be missing next to players on the winning team when a match ended abruptly (a fast resign-out can leave a teammate's end-of-match state unwritten in the game's memory). The match card now credits the win to the whole team — the same way the ratings have always counted these games.
- **v1.1.15** — pick your own key for showing/hiding the overlay: **Settings → Gameplay → Menu Key** offers a dropdown of safe choices (Insert stays the default). The change applies immediately and is remembered between sessions.
- **v1.1.14** — match start and end are now detected from the game's player roster, which is more robust than the previous method — more reliable detection in Deathmatch and after mid-match reconnects. No change to your stats, ratings, or match history.
- **v1.1.13** — maintenance: settings-file handling was tidied up — `ms_trueskill_config.txt` now keeps only the entries this overlay actually uses, and entries left behind by older versions are cleaned out automatically. Your settings are kept; no gameplay-visible changes.
- **v1.1.12** — fixed the Settings tab's Ranked Mode row: its dropdown overlapped the label. All settings rows now line up with a consistent gap.
- **v1.1.11** — the Newer/Older arrows in the Match History tab stay in a fixed spot when changing pages, so you can click through games without moving the mouse.
- **v1.1.10** — players not on the Verified Roster keep the game's own rank icon in the lobby and scoreboard instead of showing rank 1 — no rating art is drawn for players whose matches don't move the ladder.
- **v1.1.9** — fixed a match-upload bug: when the same players played again and the same team won both games, the second game was silently never uploaded — it stayed on the recording PC and never reached the leaderboard. Rematches now always upload.
- **v1.1.8** — the Update button now sits next to the version number at the bottom of the Settings tab, and double-clicking `HaloWarsStatsLoader.exe` now explains to use the `.bat` scripts instead of dumping a flag reference.
- **v1.1.7** — first release delivered through the in-game updater itself.
- **v1.1.6** — **the overlay updates itself from now on**: when a new version is out, one click in the Settings tab installs it — nothing to unzip, nothing to reinstall, settings kept. `Update.bat` does the same outside the game.
- **v1.1.5** — Match History shows each team's average rank next to the win/loss mark, so you can see how the two sides matched up at a glance.
- **v1.1.4** — the UNRANKED badge now names *every* player keeping a match out of the ratings, not just the first one.
- **v1.1.3** — the lobby rank icons switch on instantly instead of needing a restart, and other players' games show up on the leaderboard up to 6× sooner.
- **v1.1.2** — fixed settings and community sync silently failing when the install path contains non-English characters.
- **v1.1.1** — startup diagnostics for the in-game rank icons, so a failure to draw them can be traced.
- **v1.1** — the community leaderboard built in: the shared match history downloads on first launch and your games upload automatically.
- **v1.0** — first public release: TrueSkill and CSR ratings, match history, and in-game rank icons.

Full notes for each version are on the [Releases](../../releases) page. Updating is one click from inside the game — see [Updating](#updating). Your ratings and match history are never at risk; they are not kept in that folder.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **Halo Wars: Definitive Edition — Microsoft Store / Xbox app version** (the Steam version is not supported by this tool)
- **No administrator rights**

**Does it need administrator?** No — and no UAC prompt at any point. The Microsoft Store version of the game runs inside a Windows sandbox (an *AppContainer*), which is why the overlay has to be loaded into the game rather than simply run alongside it. That loading is done by an ordinary user-level program, and once loaded the overlay lives inside the game's own sandbox with no privileges of its own. It only reads match results and draws its interface; it does not modify gameplay or touch any game file.

---

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page and unzip it anywhere you like. Keep `HaloWarsStatsLoader.exe`, `MSTrueSkill.dll` and `ms_trueskill_config.default.txt` **together in the same folder**. (Your own settings file, `ms_trueskill_config.txt`, is created next to them on first launch.)
2. Double-click **`Install Auto-Load.bat`** once — no terminal, no prompt, no administrator. (Prefer the command line? `HaloWarsStatsLoader.exe --install` does the same thing.)
3. Start Halo Wars from the Xbox app as usual. The overlay appears by itself a few seconds in — press **INSERT** to show or hide it (you can pick a different key later in **Settings → Gameplay → Menu Key**).

That is the whole setup. From then on it loads every time you play, and nothing is added to the game's own folder.

To stop it loading automatically, double-click `Uninstall Auto-Load.bat` (or run `HaloWarsStatsLoader.exe --uninstall`).

`HaloWarsStatsLoader.exe --status` shows what is currently set up, and `--inject` loads the overlay into a game that is already running if you would rather not install anything at all.

> Moving the folder after installing breaks it, because the autostart entry records the exact path. Run `--install` again from the new location.

---

## Updating

From v1.1.6 on, **the overlay updates itself**. When a new version is out, an **Update** button appears next to the version number at the bottom of the Settings tab: click it, let it finish, restart the game. The new files are swapped into your existing folder and your settings are untouched. Not in game? Double-click `Update.bat` in the overlay folder instead — same result.

**On v1.1.5 or older?** Those versions predate the updater, so update by hand one last time — from then on it's the button:

1. Close Halo Wars.
2. In your **old** folder, double-click `Uninstall Auto-Load.bat`.
3. Delete the old folder.
4. Download the new release, unzip it anywhere, and double-click `Install Auto-Load.bat`.

**Your ratings and match history are safe either way.** They are not stored in that folder — the overlay keeps them elsewhere and picks them straight back up, and the community leaderboard is downloaded again on first launch.

The manual route resets your **in-game settings** to defaults (the in-game updater keeps them). So if you had the lobby rank icons switched on, turn them back on once afterwards: **Settings → "Show CSR ranks on lobby players"**. It takes effect immediately, no restart.

## Why this exists

The original Halo Wars (2009) was built around a **TrueSkill™-powered ranked ladder** — skill ratings, a public leaderboard, and the climb was half the game. When **Halo Wars: Definitive Edition** was released, that entire system went with it. What DE tracks instead is a **monthly wins count** — and that is the whole of it: no skill rating, no per-match history, and it wipes every month. **This project is a rebuild of that ranked experience** for the Microsoft Store version — an in-game overlay backed by a community ladder, restoring what Definitive Edition left out and modernizing it with TrueSkill 2.

This ladder is built for — and used by — the **high-level Halo Wars: DE competitive community**: the players still competing seriously are the ones being rated on it.

Every feature below exists for a reason — either something the original game had and Definitive Edition dropped, or something DE has been getting wrong since launch. Each one says which.

## Features

### 🏆 Skill ratings & leaderboards
- **TrueSkill™** ladder — the same rating model used by Xbox Live matchmaking, tracked per game type (1v1 / 2v2 / 3v3 / Deathmatch).
- **TrueSkill 2 (CSR)** ladder — **the recommended system** — a Competitive Skill Rank powered by our from-scratch rewrite of Microsoft Research's TrueSkill 2 algorithm, with Halo-style tiers: Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond → **Onyx**, plus a **Champion** accolade for the top of the board.
- Two rank display styles, switchable in-game: modern **tier emblems** or the classic **Halo 2 1–50** numbered ranks.
- Monthly wins boards alongside the lifetime skill ladders.

**Why:** This is the part Definitive Edition took away. All DE ranks you on is **wins this month** — a board that measures how much you played rather than how well, that a grinder tops over a better player, and that wipes clean every month so nothing you do accumulates into anything. The 2009 game had a real TrueSkill ladder and a public leaderboard, and the competitive community has wanted it back ever since — a ranked scene with nothing to rank is just customs. So the ladder is rebuilt on the rating model the original ran on, with **TrueSkill 2** — the algorithm behind modern Halo ranked play, and the one **Halo Wars 2** shipped its own Bronze-to-Champion CSR on — as the main board, so the climb means what it used to and the math is better than it was. The monthly wins boards are kept too, since that is the one board DE players already have; here they simply sit next to a rating that measures skill and never resets.

### 📜 Match history
- Every ranked game recorded automatically: map, teams, leaders, scores, duration, and per-player rating changes.
- Full post-game scoreboard with every match (v2.0). Website support for these stats comes later.
- Rich in-overlay match cards with map thumbnails, leader portraits, and result icons — filter by game type, playlist, map, or player.
- Each team's **average rank** on the match card, so you can see how the two sides matched up without reading every player individually. Players with no rating yet are left out of the average rather than dragging it down, and no average is shown at all while a teammate is still in placement matches — a partial number would misstate the side's strength.

**Why:** DE counts your wins for the month and keeps nothing else — not who you beat, not what you played, not how it went. The individual game leaves no trace: the post-game screen is the only place the result ever exists, and once you leave it, it is gone — no history, no head-to-head, no way to see where a rating change came from. A ladder nobody can audit is a ladder nobody trusts, so every rated game is stored in full: the receipts for each rating movement, and a record of the community's competitive history that outlasts the session it happened in.

*The map art and leader portraits used on the match cards.*

### 🌍 Country flags
- Every gamertag carries its player's country flag — on both leaderboards, on the match cards, and on the Verified Roster — with the country's name on hover. On by default, switchable in **Settings → Appearance → Country Flags**.

**Why:** This is a small international community that mostly meets through a Discord and a lobby list, and the ladder reads as a flat list of names with no sense of who is behind them. A flag next to a gamertag is the cheapest possible way to give the board that texture — it is why every long-running competitive ladder, from chess to fighting games, has always shown one. Flags come from a hand-maintained list rather than guesswork, so a player whose country isn't known shows no flag at all rather than a wrong one.

### ⚖️ Team Balancer
- Reads the lobby you are sitting in and shows the fairest way to split it, using each player's CSR on the ladder the lobby is set to. **Best Balance (CSR)** picks the split with the smallest gap between the two team averages, preferring the one that moves the fewest people; **Random Teams** is a coin toss you can re-roll once a minute. Advice only — nobody is moved for you.

**Why:** Custom lobbies get sorted by whoever is loudest in chat, and the result is usually two stacked friends against a pickup team — the games nobody enjoys and everyone remembers. The ratings already know exactly how strong each seat is, so the split that makes the match close is a calculation, not an argument. It stays advisory on purpose: the balancer never touches the game, and players still switch sides with the lobby's own CHANGE TEAMS, so a host can overrule it whenever the reason for a lineup is something CSR cannot see. Players with no rating yet are weighted at the ladder's median rather than as zeroes, so a newcomer doesn't drag a team's average through the floor.

### 🎲 Random Map
- Hosts roll the map from odds set per playlist size; verified lobbies only, starts off.

### 🎖️ In-game rank icons
- The game itself draws rank art next to players in the **pre-game lobby and the in-match scoreboard** — your opponents' ranks visible at a glance, using the classic 1–50 numerals.

**Why:** Because showing it off *is* the point. A rank nobody else can see is a private statistic, and private statistics have never made anyone queue one more game — the flex is what a ladder actually runs on. A leaderboard on a website is not the same thing: the moment that matters is the lobby, when everyone loads in and sees exactly who they are sitting across from. So the rank is drawn in the game itself, next to every player in the pre-game lobby and the in-match scoreboard. You wear yours, you see theirs, and it lands before the first base goes down — in DE's own lobby every player looks identical whether they are on their tenth game or in the top ten.

### 🌐 PC ↔ Xbox custom lobbies
- Cross-play custom-game lobbies between PC (Microsoft Store) and Xbox players: search for Xbox-hosted lobbies and advertise your own PC lobby to Xbox friends.

**Why:** Halo Wars: DE has had cross-platform problems since the day it launched — PC and Xbox players have never been able to reliably find each other's games, and the two halves of the community ended up playing separately. That split hurts far more than it would in a big game: the active competitive population is small, and cutting it in two makes a full lobby harder to fill on both sides. This makes PC and Xbox lobbies visible to each other so the community can play as one pool again.

### ⚡ FPS cap control
- Raise the game's frame-rate cap: 60 / 120 / 200 / 240 / 360 FPS, plus a built-in frame-rate meter. No config files, one hotkey.

**Why:** The frame-rate cap is the part of this game that has aged worst. Even 120 FPS is well short of what a current GPU and a 144/240/360 Hz monitor will comfortably do on a title this old — a 2009 game is not what is straining your PC — and the difference shows immediately in camera panning and unit movement. The hardware is not the limit here; the cap is. So the cap is exposed directly — one hotkey, no config-file editing — with a frame-rate meter to confirm the new one actually took.

---

## How the ratings work

Two rating systems run side by side over the same match history. Both are *earned in real matches only*, and ratings can't be edited by anyone, including us. The ladder also runs the two guards every modern ranked playlist has — **placement matches and an initial rank cap** — described [below](#placements-and-the-initial-rank-cap). Both are deliberately the kind of guard that does not distort the rating itself; the one that did was removed in v1.2.5.

**Why two:** classic **TrueSkill** is kept because it is exactly what the 2009 ladder ran on — a large part of the point here is that the original rating still exists and still means what it meant. **TrueSkill 2** is the recommended board because it is what Microsoft built after a decade of actually running TrueSkill on Halo: by its own paper it settles on a player's real level in fewer games and predicts results more accurately, and it is the model behind modern Halo ranked play. Neither is an invention of ours — both are published Microsoft Research systems implemented from the papers, so the ladder can be checked rather than taken on trust.

### TrueSkill™

TrueSkill models every player with two numbers: an estimated skill **μ** and an uncertainty **σ**. The number shown on the ladder is the **conservative estimate** (μ − 3σ) — skill the system considers *proven*, not just guessed. That has two visible effects:

- **New players start at 1** and climb quickly: while your uncertainty is high, every result teaches the system a lot, so your first games move your rating fast.
- **Established players move slowly**: after many games the system knows your level, so a single win or loss shifts you only a little.

### TrueSkill 2 (CSR)

CSR runs on **TrueSkill 2** — the successor algorithm Microsoft designed for modern Halo ranked play, and the system **Halo Wars 2 launched with**: a TrueSkill 2 CSR running Bronze to Champion. Our engine is a **from-scratch rewrite implemented directly from the published research paper** ([*TrueSkill 2: An improved Bayesian skill rating system* — Minka, Cleven & Zaykov, Microsoft Research, 2018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/trueskill-2-improved-bayesian-skill-rating-system/)), running the full Bayesian factor-graph update, not an approximation. Both the paper and the math are published right here in this repo: a faithful Markdown transcription of the full paper ([reference/TRUESKILL2_PAPER.md](reference/TRUESKILL2_PAPER.md)) and the MIT-licensed ([license](reference/LICENSE)) **Python reference implementation** ([reference/trueskill2/](reference/trueskill2/)) that the in-game engine is verified against — the two agree to ~1e-13, so anyone can check the ladder's math. **This is the recommended rating system** — the one we use as the main competitive ladder — and it maps skill onto the **same Bronze-to-Champion tiers Halo Wars 2 shipped with**. That is deliberate: this game's own sequel already settled what a Halo Wars rank looks like, so Definitive Edition gets that ladder rather than something invented here. Each tier below Onyx has six sub-ranks of 50 CSR each:

| Tier | CSR range |
|---|---|
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-bronze-1.png" width="32" align="center"> **Bronze 1–6** | 0 – 299 |
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-silver-1.png" width="32" align="center"> **Silver 1–6** | 300 – 599 |
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-gold-1.png" width="32" align="center"> **Gold 1–6** | 600 – 899 |
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-platinum-1.png" width="32" align="center"> **Platinum 1–6** | 900 – 1199 |
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-diamond-1.png" width="32" align="center"> **Diamond 1–6** | 1200 – 1499 |
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-onyx.png" width="32" align="center"> **Onyx** | 1500+ (shows your exact CSR) |
| <img src="assets/csr/csr-champion.png" width="32" align="center"> **Champion** | Top ten on the board, over the Champion floor — **1825**, the same on every playlist |

*The actual tier emblems the overlay and leaderboards display.*

Everyone starts at CSR 0 with maximum uncertainty. Like TrueSkill, early games move you hundreds of CSR at a time while the system finds your level; once established, a typical match moves you a few dozen. **Champion is not a CSR threshold you can camp** — it is an accolade worn by the **top ten players who have also cleared the Champion floor**, recalculated as the leaderboard changes. That floor is **rank 47** on the 1–50 ladder below — **1825 CSR**, the same number on every playlist. Both conditions apply: clearing the floor alone does not crown you if eleven people sit above you, and a top-ten seat does not crown you below it. A Champion is still Onyx-rated underneath.

### Placements and the initial rank cap

- **Placement matches** — your first **10 rated games in each playlist** are placement matches. Until they are done you wear a **placement diamond** showing your progress (0–9) instead of a rank — in the lobby, on match cards, everywhere — and you are not listed on the skill leaderboards yet (the monthly wins boards still count everyone). The overlay shows your own **Placements N/10** progress under the skill boards.
- **Initial rank cap** — the rank assigned when your placements finish is capped at **Diamond 3 (CSR 1349)**. Your underlying skill estimate is never clamped: if you really are better than Diamond 3, you will climb straight past it in ranked play — the cap only stops a hot placement run from spawning at the very top of the board.

Both rules are retroactive — the shared match history is re-rated under them on every client and on the website, so everyone agrees on every number.

**Why:** every modern ranked ladder — including today's Halo — has these guards, and each closes a hole this ladder actually had: a brand-new player's rank means nothing for their first handful of games, so it shouldn't be displayed as if it did, and one lucky placement streak should not seed anyone above players with hundreds of proven games. The 2009 game shipped with neither; this ladder gets the modern ones.

A third guard — a clamp on what a heavy favourite could gain — ran from v1.2.0 and was **removed in v1.2.5 for making the ratings inaccurate**. It wrote its +2 result back into the rating rather than just the number on screen, so the stored figure was no longer what the system had actually concluded, and every later match started from the wrong place — for the clamped player and, since ratings move against the opposing team's numbers, for their opponents as well. A rating that no longer tracks skill defeats the point of having one. The rules that stop farming without that cost are the ones that refuse to rate a match at all — the Verified Roster, uneven lineups, the map-size check — because they leave a record out instead of distorting what a counted one produces.

### Halo 2 style: ranks 1–50

Prefer the classic ladder? Switch the display to **Halo 2 1–50** ranks (in the overlay and the in-game lobby/scoreboard icons). Your CSR is mapped onto the iconic 50-rank ladder:

**Why offer it at all:** because what players want here pulls in two directions, and nothing forces a choice between them. Halo Wars 2 moved the series onto CSR tiers and that is the right modern answer — but a large part of this community never stopped wanting the classic **1–50**, the ladder they grew up climbing, where one number says what a tier badge cannot: Diamond 3 tells you roughly where you sit, a 43 tells you exactly. Nobody is actually arguing about the rating — **TrueSkill 2's accuracy is what everyone wants underneath** — only about how it is drawn. So the numbers are a display setting, not a second rating system: same CSR, same maths, same leaderboard position, shown as tiers or as 1–50, whichever you would rather wear.

Just like the original, the climb gets steeper near the top. Ranks **1–39** are the low band — about **36 CSR** each, from 0 up to 1418. Rank **40** opens at **1419**, and from there the last ten ranks are spaced evenly to the finish line: rank **50** takes **2000** CSR, so a rank up here costs about **58**. Ranks never get cheaper as you climb, and **the ladder is the same on every playlist** — a 47 is a 47 whether you earned it in 1v1, 2v2 or 3v3.

**Why one ladder for every board:** the top of the ladder was briefly split per playlist — finishing at 2100 in 1v1, 2000 in 2v2, 1900 in 3v3 — to make a high rank cost the same effort everywhere. What it actually cost was the thing the 1–50 is for: one number everybody reads the same way. A 48 meant three different ratings depending on which board it was sitting on, and no two players could be compared at a glance. One curve on every board is how the classic ladder worked, and it is what the numbers run on now. Nothing about the rating changed with it — only the numeral drawn beside your CSR.

Here is the whole ladder against the tier system:

Bold marks the **Champion floor** (rank 47) and the **rank-50 finish line**. Ranks 47-50 are listed as **Champion** because that is the crest worn up there — but it is earned, not automatic: those ranks are Onyx-rated, and the crest goes to the **top ten players** who have also cleared the floor.

On tiers up here: rank 40 is **Diamond 5 – 6**, the Diamond 6 → **Onyx** crossover at 1500 CSR falls inside rank 41, and everything from rank 42 up is Onyx.

A rank that spans two sub-ranks (rank 2 is Bronze 1–2, for example) is simply one rank being wider than one 50-CSR sub-rank. **Champion** is not on this ladder as a rank of its own: from rank 47 up, the top ten players wear the Champion crest over their Onyx rating.

### Example: a new player's first session

1. You install the tool and play your first ranked 3v3 — you show as **rank 1 / CSR 0** (unproven, not "bad").
2. You win two games against mid-Gold opponents: the system learns fast — you jump to mid-Silver territory in one evening.
3. You lose to a Diamond team: barely moves you — losing to better players is expected and costs little.
4. Over the next ~10–20 games your uncertainty shrinks, the swings get smaller, and your rating settles where you actually play.

All of this is visible live on the **[stats site](https://halo-wars-definitive-edition-stats.pages.dev)**: full leaderboards, every player's rating history, and recent games with per-match rating changes.

## Where the data comes from

**Halo Wars: Definitive Edition has no official API** — no Halo Waypoint stats, no public match service, nothing to query. So as each ranked match ends, the overlay reads the match data directly from the running game's memory (map, teams, leaders, scores, duration — the same info as the post-game screen) and syncs it to the shared community database that powers the ladder and the [stats site](https://halo-wars-definitive-edition-stats.pages.dev). Every player in a match reports the same game independently and duplicates are merged, so the ladder stays consistent without any official service behind it.

## Joining the ladder

Downloading the overlay connects you to the community history immediately — the leaderboards fill in on first launch, and your finished matches upload automatically. **Being rated** is one step more: the ladder is an invite list (the Verified Roster), and a match moves ratings only when every player in it is verified — that's what keeps the board free of smurfs, farming, and fake results.

1. Open the overlay (**INSERT** by default) → **Verified Roster** tab → **Request to join** (it fills in your gamertag).
2. A community moderator approves the request — once you're on the roster, your ratings recompute automatically, **past games included**.
3. Until then your games are recorded and visible in Match History, they just don't move anyone's rating yet.

**Opting out entirely:** delete the `sync_server_url` and `sync_api_key` lines from `ms_trueskill_config.txt` next to the DLL — with them removed, the overlay is a purely local tracker and nothing is ever uploaded anywhere.

## FAQ

**Is this a cheat?**
No. The overlay records match outcomes and displays ratings/statistics. It does not provide any gameplay advantage.

**Does it work with the Steam version?**
Not currently — this tool targets the Microsoft Store version.

**Where do the ratings come from?**
Every match is rated with the TrueSkill™ and TrueSkill 2 algorithms — the published rating systems designed for Xbox Live and Halo matchmaking, rewritten from the original research papers — over a shared community ladder. See [How the ratings work](#how-the-ratings-work) above, and browse the whole ladder on the [stats site](https://halo-wars-definitive-edition-stats.pages.dev).

**The game has no API — how do you get match data at all?**
The overlay records each match's results from your own game as it ends — see [Where the data comes from](#where-the-data-comes-from).

**How do I join the ranked ladder?**
The ladder uses a verified player roster to keep ratings fair. You can file a join request directly from the in-game overlay.

**Can my rating go down for losing to a much better player?**
Only slightly — both systems weigh results by how *surprising* they are. Losing to a favorite costs little; beating one pays a lot.
